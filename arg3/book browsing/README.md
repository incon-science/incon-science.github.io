# 3D Book Browsing

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/xrRPRL](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/xrRPRL).

A CSS-only demo that simulates picking books off a shelf and previewing a page (on hover) in first-person. It all works using labels and offscreen radio inputs for each book, and a reset input as a Return button allows you to put everything back to its original position. I made up almost all the titles which parody random novels, developer attitudes, and some dark Internet things.

### Notes
* No 3D support in IE
* Strange state animation behavior in Safari I have no idea how to fix

Update 12/13/23: Restored after being broken by Sass upgrade
